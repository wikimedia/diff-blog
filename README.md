# Diff
Diff (diff.wikimedia.org) is a blog by and for the Wikimedia volunteer community to connect and share learnings, stories, and ideas from across our movement. 

The maintenance and support of Diff is facilitated by the Communications team at the Foundation with dedicated staff to support the editorial process. We plan to present Diff to all community-facing teams, and we are looking forward to hearing your feedback and suggestions. If you have any questions or ideas for something you'd like to share, please let us know.
