Smart, intuitive, fast and powerful tool to surprise your website visitors and 
comment readers. This is an unique function on your comment area which will 
translate comment content to 60 different languages. It internationalizes website 
content discussions and increase visitor engagement. As a base API for comment 
translation we’ve chosen Yandex.Translation, because it has very reasonable 
limits for free usage. It can be used for free in websites, which do not exceed 
10m characters a month (and no more than 1m in 24 hours). The Google Translation 
API doesn’t have free plans, , however it’s available too. You’ll get all 
instructions to configure and activate inline Google translation.
