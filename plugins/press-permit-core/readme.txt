== Description ==

[PublishPress Permissions](https://publishpress.com/permissions) is the plugin for advanced WordPress permissions. It goes far beyond the options you'll find in the WordPress core. With PublishPress Permissions you can enable or block access to specific posts, pages, categories and other content on your site. You can apply these permissions for roles, individual users, and even custom groups.

There are too many features to mention in a short introduction, but here's one example: PublishPress Permissions allows you to customize viewing and editing access for almost any content built on the WordPress post types platform. Open a Post, Page or custom post type, and you'll be able to decide which roles, users or custom groups can view and edit that content.

= Control Viewing Permissions for WordPress Content = 

PublishPress Permissions enables you to customize viewing access for WordPress content. Open any post and you'll see a box with the label, "Permissions: Read this Post". This box allows you to choose "Enabled" or "Blocked" for any user role or individual user. You can also set permissions for all users who are guests, and those who are logged in.

= Control Editing Permissions for WordPress Content = 

PublishPress Permissions allows you to customize the editing permissions for all your content. Open a Post, Page, Category, Tag, or custom post type and you can decide who is allowed to edit that content.
[Click here to see how to create editing viewing permissions](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/editing-permissions/).

= Create Your Own User Groups =

PublishPress Permissions allows you to create your own user groups. Imagine you want to give some users access to a single Post. Instead of creating a new user role and applying all the permissions, you can easily add those users to a group. This is a simple and more flexible alternative to user roles.
[Click here to see how to utilize custom user groups](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/groups/).

= Manage Access to the Media Library = 
PublishPress Permissions gives you detailed control over access to media on your WordPress site. You decide who gets to edit and view files in your Media Library. For example, you can set up WordPress so that users only have access to files that they uploaded. Or you can add an exception so users can edit other people's media files if they are attached to a post they can edit.

= Show Content Teasers =

PublishPress Permissions Pro allows you to display a teaser for unreadable content. This is perfect for making small snippets of your content available to the public. You can have teaser text that is publicly available, followed by private content that is only visible for your site's users. If you choose to display a login form, the redirect will go to the originally requested content.

= Automatically Create Posts for Users =

This Pro feature allows you to automatically create content for your users. For example, you can sync your staff members to Pages. This would allow your staff to each have their own page to edit and update. You can use this feature to automatically create posts, WooCommerce products, or any other post type that is defined on your site.

= Create Your Own Workflow Statuses =

WordPress provides some status options including "Draft", "Pending Review" and "Published". Permissions Pro enables you to design a far more advanced workflow. Each status you create can have its own unique capability requirements.
[Click here to see how to build your own workflow statuses](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/multi-step-moderation/).

= Create Your Own Visibility Statuses =

With PublishPress Permissions Pro, you can create visibility options for your content. One example is a "Premium" status that makes content visible only for paying members. Another example is a "Staff" status, for the people who run your site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does PublishPress Permissions compare to PublishPress Capabilities, User Role Editor and other role editor plugins? =

PublishPress Permissions can be used in addition to a basic role editor / user management plugin.  Those plugins are designed to modify existing WordPress permissions. That's a valuable task, and in many cases will be all the role customization you need. We do recommend [PublishPress Capabilities](https://wordpress.org/plugins/capability-manager-enhanced) which is a WordPress role editor designed for integration with PublishPress Permissions.

PublishPress Permissions can supercharge your permissions engine and goes much further than the basic role editor plugins. PublishPress Permissions is particularly useful when you want to customize access to a specific post, category or term. PublishPress Permissions adds content-specific editing permissions, custom post status permissions, file access restriction, and other features which are not possible in default WordPress. 

= Important Note for Pro users upgrading from Press Permit Core 2.6.x =

In June 2019, with version 2.7, the Pro plugin packaging changed. Pro users previously running Press Permit Core + PP extensions should download PublishPress Permissions Pro from publishpress.com before upgrading a 2.6.x site to this version. PublishPress Permissions Pro is now a separate plugin which replaces both Press Permit Core and all PP extension plugins. Contact us for assistance in migrating your account. 

= What about Role Scoper? =

Moving forward, we do not plan any major development of the Role Scoper code base. If you encounter issues with Role Scoper and need to migrate to a different solution, [PublishPress Permissions](https://publishpress.com/permissions) provides access to an import script which can automate the majority of your Role Scoper migration.

= Can I import settings from Role Scoper? =

Yes. [PublishPress Permissions](https://publishpress.com/permissions) can import the most Role Scoper groups, roles, restrictions and options.  Some manual follow up may be required for some configurations.

= Is PublishPress Permissions an out-of-the-box membership solution? =

No, but it can potentially be used in conjunction with an e-commerce or membership plugin. If you have a way to sell users into a WordPress role or BuddyPress group, PublishPress Permissions can grant access based on that membership.

= Where does PublishPress Permissions store its settings?  How can I completely remove it from my database? =

PublishPress Permissions creates and uses the following tables: pp_groups, pp_group_members, ppc_roles, ppc_exceptions, ppc_exception_items. PublishPress Permissions options stored to the WordPress options table have an option name prefixed with "presspermit_". Due to the potential damage incurred by accidental deletion, no automatic removal is currently available. You can use a SQL editing tool such as phpMyAdmin to drop the tables and delete options with option_name LIKE presspermit_%.
